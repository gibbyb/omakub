# Sunhat

## A Fork of Omakub, turned into a Fedora Config

### Note: This is my personal config. I wouldn't necessarily recommend using it.

#### Install:
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/gibbyb/sunhat/releases/download/1.0/install.sh | bash
```

##### Themes:
Themes in this repo for the most part have been removed, except for the easy stuff like changing the theme in VS Code. On Fedora, I would recommend Gradience Beta, which is installed by this app, for theming the GNOME shell. I will eventually add more themes for Kitty & Neovim, and I may even make some themes for the GNOME shell using Gradience.

##### To Do:

- [ ] Add a way to change the font & theme of kitty using the script
- [ ] Add a themes for Neovim that are not using LazyVim
- [ ] Configure GNOME extensions with cli tool.
- [ ] Add a way to update all packages installed with git in the packages folder.
- [ ] Add a way to update all links to packages installed by link
