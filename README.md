## A Fork of Omakub, turned into a Fedora Config

### Note: This is my personal config. I wouldn't necessarily recommend using it.

#### To Do:

- [ ] Add a way to change the font & theme of kitty using the script
- [ ] Add a themes for Neovim that are not using LazyVim
- [ ] Configure GNOME extensions with cli tool.
- [ ] Find a consistent way to download applications not in repos.
- [ ] Add a way to update all packages installed with git in the packages folder.
- [ ] Add a way to update all links to packages installed by link
